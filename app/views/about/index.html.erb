                    <p>My mom taught me to sew and quilt about 10 years ago. My first project was a simple table runner, I got hooked immediately. I became fascinated with the process of taking material, sewing it together and creating something so beautiful that could be cherished for generations.</p>
                    <p>I also discovered my inner artist with my ability to combine colors and patterns well. T-shirt quilts have become a favorite of mine because of the joy and memories it brings to people. It is a very nice way to hold on to all those t-shirts instead of keeping them tucked away in a drawer.</p>
                    <p>A couple other things: In the past couple years I've found my passion for running/fitness and I am completely in love with all things coffee. So, I apologize in advance for the possibility of a few random coffee pics here and there. :-)</p>
